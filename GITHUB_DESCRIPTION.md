# Bugtracker

## Project Initialization and First Commit

This repository was initialized and the first commit was made with the following steps:

```sh
echo "# Bugtracker" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Nirmalkoswatta/Bugtracker.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

This documents the initial setup and push to GitHub as part of a full day's work on the Bugtracker project.
